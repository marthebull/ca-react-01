### Description of project

In this project, I built an e-commerce store using React. The store consists of essential pages: a homepage displaying products with a search bar, individual product pages with detailed information, discounts, and reviews, a cart page to manage added products, a checkout success page for order confirmation, and a contact page with form validation.

To ensure a cohesive user experience, I implemented a <Layout> component with a header containing a navigation bar and a cart icon displaying the item count. React Router enables smooth navigation between pages. The design is responsive, catering to various screen sizes.

In summary, this project involves a responsive e-commerce store with essential pages, including product listings, detailed product pages, a cart system, checkout confirmation, and a contact page with form validation, all developed using React and clean coding practices.

<br />

### Goal
  
The goal of this project is to build an e-commerce store with multiple pages using React. The API to be used for this project is https://api.noroff.dev/api/v1/online-shop.
  
<br />
  
### Brief 

The following pages need to be implemented:

1. Homepage:
   - Display a list of all products.
   - Include a look-ahead search bar for filtering products by name.
   - Clicking on a product should navigate to the individual product page.

2. Individual Product Page:
   - Display detailed information about a single product.
   - Include the title, description, and image of the product.
   - Show reviews for the product if available.
   - Utilize the discountedPrice property to display the price, calculating and displaying any discounts.

3. Cart Page:
   - Display a list of products added to the cart.
   - Show the total amount for the products in the cart.
   - Include a Checkout button.

4. Checkout Success Page:
   - Display a message confirming a successful order.
   - Provide a link to go back to the store.
   - Clear the cart upon reaching this page.

5. Contact Page:
   - Include a contact form with fields for full name, subject, email, and body.
   - Implement form validation with specific requirements for each field.

Additional Project Details:

- Use a `<Layout>` component that contains a header and footer.
- The header should include a navigation bar and a Cart icon component displaying the number of items in the cart.
- Implement routing using React Router to switch between pages.
- Design the application to be responsive, considering various screen sizes.
- You can choose to use a CSS Framework, but it is encouraged to design from scratch using styled-components or CSS Modules.
- TypeScript usage is not required.
- Ensure clean and well-formatted code.

By completing this project, you will have built an e-commerce store with essential pages, product details, a cart system, and a contact form with validation.
